A,B,CNNs with Timp

With the help of your linear regression model, dino tim was able to find a thriving customer base for his gym, and has finally
cultivated some solid jurrasic gymbros. To celebrate his gym, and your presence in the MANAS taskphase, dino tim decided to
throw a picnic at the MANAS gardens. 
Since dinos have a voracious appetite that could not be supported on a student project budget, he requested all the dinos to bring their own food, and the dinos, gym bros that they were,
decided to bring a healthy salad of leafy greens.
On the day of the picnic, the dinos laid out a solid spread. However, the good times would not last as a strong wind blew away all
the leaves into one massive pile.
Dino Tim once again turns to you, his truest friend, to create a CNN model to classify each of the leaves to the respective dino.
In the folder he gave you, he also kept his vacation photos, classify those as well.
